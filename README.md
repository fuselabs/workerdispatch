# Worker Dispatch

This repository is an early prototype of a general purpose worker dispatch tool for mobile devices. We designed this over the 2015 summer in conjunction with labor ogranizations, in support of possible future open-sourced peer-economy platforms.
 
We hope releasing this project will encourage others to build on it, and extend it to different scenarios. We do not intend to maintain this repository in the near future, but hope that others might take this codebase as a starting point for building an open-sourced peer-economy platform. 
 
One such fork is being maintained by one of the original authors of the code: https://github.com/alialkhatib/workerCoop
 
Bug reports and contributions can be made to the active forked-repository above.
