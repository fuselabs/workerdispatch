# Worker Dispatch

This repository is an early prototype of a worker-centric peer economy dispatch tool for mobile devices. 
 
We've released this project with the intention of encouraging others to build on it, and extend it to other scenarios. We do not intend to maintain this repository, but hope that others are able to take this sample code and reuse this codebase as a starting point for building an open-sourced peer-economy platform. 
 
Here is one such project that is being maintained by one of the original authors of the code: [https://github.com/alialkhatib/workerCoop]
 
Bug reports and contributions can be made to the maintained forked-repositories above. For any other questions contact workerdispatch@microsoft.com
